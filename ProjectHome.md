## About ##
Apple's [Time Machine](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html) is a great feature in their OS, and Linux  has almost all of the required technology already built in to recreate it.  This is a simple GUI to make it easy to use.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol><li>Download the "featured download" .deb file, highlighted on the right.<br>
</li><li>Double-click to install.<br>
</li><li>Launch it from the menu: "Applications" => "System Tools"</li></ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>

Git cannot archive files that can't fit into main memory.  So most large files are excluded from backups by default (in the preferences).  Hopefully they will fix this bug soon.<br>
